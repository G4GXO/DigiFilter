The DigiFilter DSP Audio Processor for Radio Communications

Ths project is based upon Microchip's dsPIC33FJ128GP802 and implements a variable bandwidth AF filter, an
NLMS Denoiser, NLMS Autonotch and Binaural output. The unit can store up to 8 filter settings recalled
from a "presets" header and features a menu system announced in Morse Code.

The source files require to be compiled in Microchip's MPLAB-X using the XC16 Compiler after which the
hex file can be programmed into the processor using a suitable programmer/debugger.
